## Design direction

- Comfortable spacing for long reading sessions
- Editorial serif headings with restrained sans-serif body text
- Warm neutral palette instead of stark pure white
- Clean code blocks tuned for technical writing
- Tables are tuned for calmer scanning, with fewer borders, steadier numeric alignment, and a more editorial reading rhythm

## Sample File

The repository includes `theme-showcase.md` and `theme-showcase.en.md` for quick previewing and screenshots in Typora.

It is designed to show:

- heading hierarchy and body spacing
- inline code and fenced code blocks
- blockquotes, footnotes, links, and keyboard key styling
- the table treatment that was tuned specifically for this theme

If you want to add screenshots to the repository, use `theme-showcase.md` for the Chinese README and `theme-showcase.en.md` for the English README.

## Table Design

The table styling is not a minor tweak of the default Typora table. It was adjusted for technical reading:

- vertical lines and extra background treatments are removed to reduce grid noise
- headers use a tighter uppercase treatment for faster scanning
- numbers use `tabular-nums` so adjacent values compare more cleanly
- cells have more breathing room and a larger minimum width
- the first column carries slightly stronger weight, which works well for labels or section names
- wide tables can scroll horizontally instead of collapsing the layout

## Installation

1. Open Typora.
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Appearance`.
3. Open the Typora themes folder.
4. Copy `clawlike.css`, `clawlike-dark.css`, and the `clawlike` folder into that directory.
5. Restart Typora or switch themes from the theme menu.

## Fonts

For the intended appearance, place these files under `themes/clawlike/fonts/`:

- `AnthropicSans-Roman-Web.woff2`
- `AnthropicSans-Italic-Web.woff2`
- `AnthropicSerif-Roman-Web.woff2`
- `AnthropicSerif-Italic-Web.woff2`

These font files are not distributed with this theme. Please obtain them yourself from lawful sources. If they are unavailable, the theme will fall back to the bundled font stack.
